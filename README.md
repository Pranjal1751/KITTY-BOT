# KITTY-BOT

Four leged animal robot.

# Abstract:

The aim of the project is to make a four leged robot which mimics the locomotion of the animal. It can walk easily on such terrains where,
wheeled bots may get some difficulties due to roughed surface.

# Acknowledgement:

We would like to express our special thanks of gratitude to our mentors Aman Singh Sir(ME 3rd year),      (ECE 3rd year)
and Jashan Sir(BT 4th year) as well as our guide and senior mentor Shivam Shrivastava Sir(EE 4th year & secretary, Models and
